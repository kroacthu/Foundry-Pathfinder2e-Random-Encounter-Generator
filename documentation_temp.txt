2.3 Requirements
Break down the requirements to provide a ballpark estimate.
2.3.1 Functional Requirements
Functional requirements describe what the system should do. They include detailed descriptions of the system's functions, features, and behaviors.
Example:
  - Requirement 1 (R1): The system shall allow users to log in using a username and password.
  - Requirement 2 (R2): The system shall allow users to upload files to the server.
2.3.2 Non-Functional Requirements
Non-functional requirements describe how the system performs a function, focusing on aspects such as:
1) Performance (throughput, response time, scalability);
2) Reliability(availability, error handling);
Example:
  - Performance: The system shall handle up to 1000 concurrent users without performance degradation.
  - Reliability: The system shall have 99.9% uptime.
2.3.3 Technical Requirements
Technical requirements specify the technical aspects that must be met, including hardware, software, and technology constraints.
Example:
  - Hardware: The system shall run on servers with at least 16GB of RAM and 4 CPUs.
  - Software: The system shall be developed using Java and run on a Tomcat server.
2.3.4 Security Requirements
Security requirements outline the measures that must be implemented to protect the system and its data.
Example:
  - Authentication: The system shall use multi-factor authentication for all user logins.
  - Data Encryption: All sensitive data shall be encrypted both in transit and at rest.

Section 7 - Testing 
This section covers the strategies and practices for ensuring the quality and reliability of the software through various stages of testing and monitoring. It includes end-to-end testing, environment setups (Test, UAT, Prod), and Quality Assurance (QA) processes.
7.1 Test Plan Creation:
A test plan is a comprehensive document that outlines the strategy, scope, resources, schedule, and activities required for testing. It ensures that all aspects of the application are thoroughly tested.
Components of a Test Plan:
- Objective: Define the goals of testing (e.g., validate new features, ensure stability).
- Scope: Specify what is and is not included in the testing.
- Resources: List the personnel, tools, and environments required.
- Schedule: Detail the timeline for testing activities.
- Test Cases: Define individual tests with steps, expected results, and actual results.
Test environment:

Section 8 - Monitoring
Monitoring is a critical component of maintaining the health, performance, and security of an application. It involves collecting, analyzing, and acting upon various metrics and logs to ensure the system operates smoothly and meets user expectations. In this section, define how and where it would be monitored, thresholds etc. 
Key metrics to monitor include:
- Performance Metrics: Response times, throughput, server load, CPU usage, memory usage.
- Error Metrics: Error rates, types of errors, affected users.
- Availability Metrics: Uptime, downtime, service availability.
- User Metrics: Active users, user sessions, retention rates.
